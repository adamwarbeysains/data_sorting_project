# Data Sorting Project

## The aims of this project

The aim of this project was to create a programme which reads data (integers) from a file and then sorts them in numerical order. Once this is done the median of these integers can then be caluclated. It was important to make these processes as efficient as possible as the amount of data to sort could be very large.

## The sorting algorithm used

After researching different sorting algorithms, the decision was made to use *quicksort*. *Quicksort* chooses a pivot point (usually the element furthest to the right), then creates a list of elements smaller than or equal to the pivot and another list containing elements greater than the pivot. This process is then repeated iteratively, as can be seen in the following diagram:
